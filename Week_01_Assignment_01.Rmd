## Spark on demand with AZTK
Since I'm interested in Big Data and Spark is one of the most common tools used in Big Data, I found this video really interesting.

Presenter talks about Azure Distributed Data Engineering Toolkit (AZTK) and It uses AZTK to manage spark clusters and makes it easier to use. It can use users already existing docker images so it is easier to move onto AZTK and It uses docker containers to run spark clusters.

Even tough video is published at 2018 technology relatively new to me, it might be because insurance companies focuses on security and being robust more important than fast/easy to use systems.
